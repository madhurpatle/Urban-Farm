# Urban Farm

Urban Farm is an app that helps farmers get reach to their potential buyers and markets in an efficient and elaborate way. This is achieved by elimination of middle men in the farmers value chain by deploying machine learning models of the market current trends and suggesting the best patterns of market demands with the changing dynamics of the economy.

# About App

This app gives a direct link of farmers to customers, such that a customer is able to talk directly to a farmer and have the burgaining power with the farmer. Customer needs and changes are then shared with farmers to ensure a better service of the futer of the product or service.

# Description
Farming has been the major feeder of most developing countries in Africa and Asia , Indian majorly rely on farm products for an economic sustainability. India being my area of study, i found out that a whole 65% of people who live in rural areas do not seek for skilled office employment, but depend entirely on harvested crops in order for them to make a living. However, they are normally faced with the challenge of getting a very efficient and elaborate way to sell their farm produce and maximize on their value. Many end up getting little pay for their hardwork due to the ever extending middle men in the value chain. They are also faced with the challenge of being able to predict the ever changing flavour of customers on their products. This is the most fundermental reason why I created E-Mandi application.

Whats my goal here?

“The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.” ― Masanobu Fukuoka, The One-Straw Revolution

My goal here is to create a condusive environment for farmers and customers, allowing them to maximize on their profits, without compromising on quality using the best, efficient and easiest way using a machine learning model that is able to predict the changing patterns of farmers. Being able to notify customers whenever the harvest of a particular crop diminishes and being able to alert farmers of the current needs of customers interms of variety and preferences.

To maintain the best of my goal , i have made this app to have several farmers and customers.

The user creates an account and is able to access the various crops or services from farmers. He/she then can deside to order whetever they prefer, the app studies this specific users action and saves on a machine model which then comes us with a predictive analysis of what specific customers and genders like and at what period and under what conditions.

This gives more insights on the farmers side, They are able to do farming geared towards users preferences based on gender, times and tastes. This gives a further analysis of what the farmer should concentrate on more in order to maximize the production value chain. Profits are maximized as customers interact directly with farmers and they can negotiate basing on users preferences. This helps farmers to have more confidence in their sales and will make farming in Asian countries have more value than as it is at the moment where lots os middle men kill the farming value chain.
